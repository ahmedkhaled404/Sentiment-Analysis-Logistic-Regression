<h1>Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews using NLP</h1>

**1. Introduction**

*Objective:* This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis pipeline for movie reviews on IMDB. This involves classifying sentiment into positive and negative categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The project aims to build an efficient model for sentiment classification, compare the performance of traditional methods, and provide insights into the effectiveness of these methods.

**2. Data Description**

*Dataset Source:*

*Data Overview:*

-   **Number of Instances:** 39,723
-   **Features:**
    -   text: The review text.
    -   label: Sentiment label (0 for negative, 1 for positive).

*Data Splits:*

-   **Train + Validation Set:** 85%
-   **Test Set:** 15%
-   **Validation Set:** 15%

**3. Baseline Experiments**

*Initial Steps:*

1.  **Data Import and Inspection:**
    -   Loaded data from CSV file.
    -   Checked for null values and data types.
2.  **Data Exploration (EDA):**
    -   Verified the shape and distribution of data.
    -   Checked for duplicates and removed them.
    -   Analyzed class imbalance and word count distribution.

*Baseline Analysis Results:*

-   **Class Distribution:** Balanced (almost equal number of positive and negative reviews).

**4. Advanced Experiments**

*4.1 Data Preprocessing*

**Text Cleaning:**

-   Converted text to lowercase and removed punctuation.

**Tokenization and Lemmatization:**

-   Used NLTK (Natural Language Tool Kit) for tokenization and lemmatization.
-   Implemented part-of-speech tagging for accurate lemmatization.

**Stop Words Removal:**

-   Removed common stop words using NLTKâ€™s stop words list.

**Feature Extraction:**

-   Used TF-IDF vectorizer to transform text data into feature vectors.

**Text before and after applying analysis:**

| Even though I have great interest in Biblical movies, I was bored to death every minute of the movie. Everything is bad. The movie is too long, the acting is most of the time a Joke and the script is horrible. I did not get the point in mixing the story about Abraham and Noah together. So if you value your time and sanity stay away from this horror. |

*4.2 Model Development and Tuning*

**Train-Test Split:**

-   Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

**Models Developed:**

1.  **Logistic Regression:**
    -   **Parameter Tuning:** Used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters.
    -   **Best Parameters:** C values of [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100] and solvers 'liblinear' and 'saga'.
    -   **Validation Accuracy:** 88.67%
    -   **Test Accuracy:** 89.31%
2.  **Naive Bayes:**
    -   **Parameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV was used to find the best alpha values.
    -   **Best Parameters:** alpha values of [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100].
    -   **Validation Accuracy:** 86.04%
    -   **Test Accuracy:** 86.02%
